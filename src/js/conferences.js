        "name":"Fakhri Karray",
        "description":`Fakhri Karray is the founding co-director of the University of Waterloo Artificial Intelligence
        Institute and is the Loblaws Research Chair in Artificial Intelligence in the Department of
        electrical and computer engineering at the University of Waterloo, Canada. He is also a
        Professor of Machine Learning and the former Provost at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of
        Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), a graduate-level, research based artificial intelligence (AI)
        university in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Fakhri’s research interests are operational AI, cognitive
        machines, natural human-machine interaction, and autonomous and intelligent systems.
        Applications of his research include virtual care systems, cognitive and self-aware
        devices/robots/vehicles, predictive analytics in supply chain management and intelligent
        transportation systems. Recent work of Fakhri and his research team on deep learning-based
        driver behavior recognition and prediction has been featured in The Washington Post, Wired
        Magazine, Globe and Mail, CBC radio and Canada&#39;s Discovery Channel. He serves as
        Associate Editor and member of the editorial board of major publications in intelligent systems
        and information fusion. His most recent textbook in foundational machine learning, “Elements of Dimensionality Reduction and Manifold Learning,” was published by Springer Nature in
        February 2023. He was honored in 2021 by the IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (VTS) with
        the IEE EVTS Best Land Transportation Paper Award for his pioneering work on improving
        traffic flow prediction with weather Information in connected cars using deep learning
        and AI. His recent work on federated learning in communication systems, earned him and his
        co-authors the 2022 IEEE Communication Society’s MeditCom Conference Best Paper Award.
        Fakhri is the co-founder and Chief Scientist of Yourika.ai, a provider of AI-based online learning systems. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering, and a
        Fellow of the Engineering Institute of Canada. He served as a Distinguished Lecturer for the
        IEEE and is a Fellow of the Kavli Frontiers of Science. Fakhri received the Ing. Dip degree in
        electrical engineering from the School of Engineering of the University of Tunis, Tunisia and the
        PhD degree from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA.
